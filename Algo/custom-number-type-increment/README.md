# Algo Section - Exercice 1 - Custom number type increment 

To run this exercice, just call `npm i` when inside folder `custom-number-type-increment`, and execute `npm start` command.  
I mainly used `console.log` to check results, and give you some comments with the code.  
I made the algorithm recursive for short and efficient code.
